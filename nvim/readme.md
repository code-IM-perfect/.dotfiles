# My nvim config
I guess it's not really accurate to call it _my_ config, cuz most of the heavy lifting was done by TJ in the kickstart.nvim project, this is just a heavily customized kickstart.nvim config...and currently very messy

I should rewrite this but am really comfortable with this setup and have no time at the moment, I will probably do so in the future idk.
