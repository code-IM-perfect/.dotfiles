# My dots
These are my config files that I'd rather not have to write again on a new system.

Although my setup isn't really all that great and I'm only maintaining these for myself, feel free to take anything you like from my configs.

Not all of my configs are here cuz some of them are too messy and I'd rather set them up again when I have time and am setting up a fresh install. I have included some of the messy ones anyways as it is unlikely I'll give them a fresh start :P
